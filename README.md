# Calculator in C

This repository contains a project for a calculator implemented in the C language, with unit tests in C++ and integration tests in Python.

## What has been done?
- A calculator has been implemented in C.
- Unit tests have been added in C++ using the googletest framework.
- Integration tests in Python are planned to be added.

## How to run?
1. To build and run the calculator:
  
   make all  
   make run
   
2. For testing:
   - make run-unit-test for unit tests
   - make run-integration-tests for integration tests (if available)

## How is it done?
The calculator is implemented in C, unit tests are written using googletest, and integration tests will be written in Python.# calculator-muratova-aa
